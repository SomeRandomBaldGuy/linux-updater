# Updater.sh

This is a small project I'm working on to create a "universal updater" that works on *most* major Linux based systems.

Once it is finished it will be compatible with Debian and it's branches such as Ubuntu and Linux Mint. It will also be compatible with Arch, Rocky, and Gentoo, to cover all of the current distributions I work with. 

I am always open to suggestions on improvements / optimizations, as well as CONSTRUCTIVE criticism.
